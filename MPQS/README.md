# MPQS
Implementation from paper: [The Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve by Robert D. Silverman](https://github.com/AJ-Wuu/Factorization/blob/main/Reference/The%20Multiple%20Polynomial%20Quadratic%20Sieve%20by%20Robert%20D.%20Silverman.pdf)  
It takes much longer than general Quadratic Sieve (for 30-digit input, MPQS takes ~30s and QS takes ~1s). More parallelism might be helpful.
