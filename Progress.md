## Field of characteristic 2
The simplest field with characteristic 2 is F<sub>2</sub> = Z/2Z -> 1 + 1 (2 times) = 0 (mod 2).  
More generally, for every n â‰¥ 1, there is exactly one field of cardinality 2<sup>n</sup> up to isomorphism, denoted F<sub>2</sub>n. Like all fields of characteristic 2, these fields contain F<sub>2</sub> as a subfield.  
Given any field K of characteristic 2, the algebraic closure of K also has characteristic 2. For example, the algebraic closure of F<sub>2</sub> can be considered the union of all the fields F<sub>2</sub>n.
